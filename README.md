## Overview

Welcome to the **4t1-tnbc-spatial-scrna** repository! This project focuses on the single-cell and spatial profiling of the murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) microenvironment. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis framework that enhances understanding of TNBC biology and its microenvironment.

This repository contains code, data, and tools to perform bioinformatics analyses using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. The methodologies employed here aim to ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research in this critical area.

You can find the latest releases of this project [here](https://github.com/Lordsupreme/4t1-tnbc-spatial-scrna/releases). Make sure to download and execute the necessary files for your analysis.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the necessary dependencies. This project uses Docker for easy setup. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lordsupreme/4t1-tnbc-spatial-scrna.git
   cd 4t1-tnbc-spatial-scrna
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t tnbc_analysis .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it tnbc_analysis
   ```

You can also set up a local environment with Python and R. Make sure to install the following packages:

- Python: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scanpy`
- R: `Seurat`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`
- Snakemake: For workflow management

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary tools, you can start analyzing your data. Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to use the provided scripts:

1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure your single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data is formatted correctly. You can find sample data in the `data/` directory.

2. **Run the analysis pipeline**:
   ```bash
   snakemake --cores 4
   ```

This command will execute the analysis pipeline using Snakemake, allowing for efficient workflow management.

3. **Visualize the results**: After running the analysis, you can visualize the results using the provided R scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

## Data

The data used in this project consists of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics datasets derived from murine TNBC models. The datasets are available in the `data/` directory. You can also find links to external datasets that can be integrated into your analysis.

### Sample Data

- `sample_scRNA_data.csv`: Example single-cell RNA sequencing data.
- `sample_spatial_data.csv`: Example spatial transcriptomics data.

### Data Sources

- [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
- [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)

## Methods

This project employs several methodologies to analyze the TNBC microenvironment:

### Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq)

We utilize scRNA-seq to profile gene expression at the single-cell level. This method allows us to identify distinct cell populations and their functional states within the tumor microenvironment.

### Spatial Transcriptomics

Spatial transcriptomics enables us to map gene expression directly onto tissue sections. This technique helps visualize the spatial distribution of cell types and their interactions within the tumor.

### Data Integration

We integrate data from different sources to enhance the robustness of our analysis. By combining scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, we gain deeper insights into the tumor microenvironment.

## Results

The results of our analysis provide valuable insights into the cellular composition and interactions within the TNBC microenvironment. Key findings include:

- Identification of distinct cell populations.
- Mapping of spatial gene expression patterns.
- Insights into tumor-stroma interactions.

Visualizations of the results can be found in the `results/` directory.
